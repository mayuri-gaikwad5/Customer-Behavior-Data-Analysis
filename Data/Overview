📊 End-to-End Customer Behavior Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow using real-world customer behavior data.
Instead of learning tools in isolation, the goal was to understand how each stage of analytics connects in a business context — from problem definition to insights and reporting.

Analytics Pipeline Followed

Business Problem → Raw Data → Cleaning & Feature Engineering → Database Storage → SQL Analysis → Visualization → Insights

🧠 1. Business Problem Definition

Businesses often face challenges in understanding customer behavior and performance drivers.

This project focuses on answering key business questions such as:

Which products perform best based on customer ratings?

Which customer age groups generate the most revenue?

How does subscription status affect customer distribution?

What purchasing patterns emerge across product categories?

Clearly defining these questions helped guide every technical decision in the analysis.

🗂️ 2. Dataset Overview (Raw Data)

The dataset represents customer behavior data, including:

Customer demographics (age, gender)

Product and category information

Purchase frequency

Review ratings

Subscription status

Payment and shipping methods

Initial Data Challenges

Missing values

Categorical variables in text format

Columns not directly suitable for analysis

Understanding the structure and quality of raw data was essential before moving forward.

🧹 3. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)
Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Key Steps
3.1 Handling Missing Values

Missing review ratings were filled using category-level median values to preserve realistic distributions.

3.2 Feature Engineering

New analytical features were created:

Age Group

Customers were grouped into quartiles:

Young Adult

Adult

Middle-aged

Senior

Purchase Frequency (Days)

Textual frequencies (Weekly, Monthly, Annually, etc.) were converted into numeric day values.

These transformations made the dataset analysis-ready and easier to interpret.

🛢️ 4. Database Storage (MySQL)

After cleaning, the dataset was exported from the Python notebook and stored in MySQL.

Why MySQL?

Simulates real-world production data storage

Enables scalable and efficient querying

Separates data processing from analytical querying

This step strengthened understanding of how analytics workflows integrate with databases in industry systems.

🧮 5. SQL-Based Analysis

SQL was used to answer the defined business questions directly at the database level.

SQL Concepts Applied

GROUP BY

AVG()

ORDER BY

LIMIT

Sample Insights

Identified Top 5 products based on average customer ratings

Analyzed revenue distribution by age group

Compared performance across product categories

SQL enabled fast, structured, and scalable analysis.

📊 6. Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI)

The analyzed data was visualized using Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.

Dashboard Elements

KPI Cards

Average purchase amount

Average review rating

Total customers

Charts

Revenue by age group

Revenue by category

Subscription status distribution

Average purchase amount by product

Slicers

Gender

Subscription status

Category

Payment method

Shipping type

Purpose of Visualization

Improve data accessibility

Enable interactive exploration

Support data-driven business decisions

🔍 7. Insights & Findings

Key insights derived from the analysis:

The majority of customers are non-subscribers, indicating strong potential for subscription growth

Young Adults contribute the highest share of revenue

Certain product categories significantly outperform others

High-value products present strong upselling opportunities

These insights can directly inform marketing, pricing, and customer retention strategies.
